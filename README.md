# Weather Forecast App

## Weather App

This is an application that enables users to search for the weather forecast of up to five days in advance for a given city. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.


## How the Weather App Works

The quiz starts with a landing page inviting the user to search for a city. Once the user types a city in the search bar and clicks 'Search', the weather for that city for the date of search and the next 5 days are displayed on the page. If the user types in another city, that city's weather will then be displayed, along with the previous city/cities searched. 
Searches are saved locally so that the user can exit the application and return to it without losing their past searches.


## Mock-Up
